# Webscraping_Projects
This Repository contains Web scraping projects using Python. 

My understanding of web scraping is patience and attention to details. When I do scraping, I typically spend 50% of my time in analyzing the source (navigate through HTML parse tree or inspect element to find the post form) and the rest 50% in ETL.

I used various tools and libraries here and put serious efforts in it.
