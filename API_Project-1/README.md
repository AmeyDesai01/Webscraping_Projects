**Weather Information of any state using Python and
Weather API - Amey Desai**

In this Python project,  we used python code that will collect weather information such as current temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, weather description and many others, of any state on the earth, using OpenWeatherMap API. 

It will find these weather information in real time by just typing the city name. It will be able to get the data about only those places which are listed (or supported) by OpenWeatherMap website.

To obtain weather information for any state using Python and a weather API, you typically follow these steps: 

1.	Choose a Weather API: 
There are several weather APIs available, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, or AccuWeather. You will need to sign up for an API key to access their weather data. For this we used OpenWeatherMap.
      

2.	Install the necessary libraries:
Use pip, the Python package installer, to install the required libraries. In this case, you'll need the requests library to make API requests and retrieve data.
      

3.	Import the necessary modules: 
In your Python script, import the necessary modules, including requests and datetime.


4.	Set up the API request: 
Construct the API request URL with your API key and the location or state you want to retrieve weather information for.
      

5.	Make the API request and retrieve data :
Use the requests.get() method to make the API request and retrieve the weather data.
      

6.	Extract relevant weather information: 
Parse the API response to extract the weather information you need. Common data includes temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
      

7.	Display the weather information: 
Use print statements to present the weather information in a readable format.
      

8.	Execute the code:
Run your Python script, and it will make the API request, retrieve the weather data, and display the information for the specified state.

Thank you.
